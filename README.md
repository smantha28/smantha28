# 👋 Hi there! I'm Sravani Mantha

✨ DevOps Engineer | Cloud Automation Enthusiast | Curious Voyager ✨

I’m passionate about transforming ideas into seamless, automated, and scalable solutions. With a **master’s degree and 3+ years of experience** as a DevOps Engineer, I specialize in cloud platforms, infrastructure automation, and CI/CD pipelines—empowering teams to innovate faster and more reliably. My toolkit includes Linux, Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, ArgoCD, Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, Azure, Python, Bash, and Shell scripting.

Currently, I'm diving into **learning Go and exploring how to integrate AI into DevOps workflows**. I'm also on a journey to deepen my understanding of AI and its practical applications in operations.

## 🚀 What I’m up to

- Automating entire DevOps workflows from code to production.
- Designing resilient cloud architectures on AWS and Azure.
- Building and optimizing CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, ArgoCD, and GitHub Actions.
- Containerizing applications and managing them at scale with Kubernetes and Docker.
- Advocating best practices in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform and Ansible.

## 🌅 Beyond the Console

When I’m not in the cloud or automating deployments, you’ll likely find me:
- 🌄 **Chasing sunsets** — wherever the sun sets, that’s where my heart soars!  
- 🏕️ **Embracing adventure** — always up for exploring new places and trying something thrilling.  
- 🧩 **Solving challenges** — I mean, who doesn’t love solving challenges? I believe stepping into tough situations only makes me stronger.
